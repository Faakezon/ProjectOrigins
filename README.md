# Project Origins

### Branches:
* Master branch-Only used to merge other branches into this one before I start working on new feature.
* Origins-V01-Inventory System



### Updates:

To do:
Fix ItemInfo scalable UI for different resolutions.
Fix the custom cursor bug so it always detect menu elements with collisions and raycast. - Should be working properly now.
Fix that ItemInfo show more specific armor type than just armor. Should display Head, Torso or Boots.

#### Origins-V01-Inventory System

Update:
* Inventory with ability to hold, equip, show items.
* Dismantle/Remove items.
* Equip / Use Items.
* Gamepad Support for Inventory System. X = Dismantle, A = Equip. Hovering over with custom cursor shows iteminfo.
* Items in inventory should be saved and loaded correctly into right slot.


#### Origins - Prior to V01

Update:
* Main Menu with custom cursor working with the Xbox One Gamepad.
* Character creation with save/load/delete functionality - Single Character game at the moment.
* Planet Explorer - The hub in the game. This is where you choose what planet to explore.
